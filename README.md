# Discord bot

### My mates call me rack, this is a discord bot, its name is rackbot

Discord used to cool. You know, cool, like the loveable yet slightly unhinged uncle who slips you 20's and brings troubled guys to christmas dinner. Then one day, discord banned rhythm, one of the most widely used music bots available. It also promptly moved all voice bot functionality to a separate API without documentation, which, must like the once-beloved uncle that is now an anti-vaxxer, makes discord NOT cool.

In saying all this, I present to you a discord bot with the following features:

 	-play, pause, queues and skip youtube videos 
 		-can either link directly or simply type in the song title and the bot will search for you
  	-allows users to interact with the GPT-3 text completion API directly from their discord servers
      	-any message in a discord chat prefaced with !openai will be fed into GPT-3 as a prompt and the bot will 
      	spit back out the result
